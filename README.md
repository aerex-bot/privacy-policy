# Aerex Bot Privacy Policy
*Last Updated: 9/12/2021*

## Introduction:
Welcome to Aerex's privacy policy! In this policy, we will go over what data the bot collects, how data is retained in our systems, how we get rid of our data, and how you can request data removal. If you have any questions, please [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/BYuUvE4) and we'll be glad to help you out.

## Data Access:
Before we begin talking about what data we collect, it's important to note that very few Aerex staff members have access to your data. Only bot administrators and bot owners can view this material and all data we collect is encrypted and protected via forms of authentication. In order for a bot administrator to access your data in particular, they must log into a dedicated data server with an approved username and password, and authenticate themselves with a form of two-factor authentication (2FA). For more sensitive data, this is locked on a physical server (in encrypted form) which requires a 2FA key to access. We regularly purge data as well, which will be covered later in this document.

## Data Collection:
Upon interacting with the bot in any way (i.e. running a command, adding the bot to a server, or any other related task), certain data will be processed. When you run a command, the bot will check your [Discord User or Server ID](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) in order to make sure you or your server are not blacklisted. When running a command, we log the command ran for our anti-spam system. The information that gets logged in this process is your user ID, the channel ID and server ID in which you ran the command in, and the command itself. This particular information is purged within 30 minutes, but if you were caught by the antispam, only a note with your user ID will be logged in our database. If you set up a moderation logging channel with Aerex, we will log messages deleted and messages edited for the sole purpose of logging it in that channel. We do store deleted messages for our `snipe` command, but this information is purged every other hour. If you wish to opt-out of our `snipe` command (be it opting yourself or your entire server out), you may [fill this form out](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjlf5wDgjW3F6hXVrz7DN14BL4cT_XwUS2K-ZLSeHgV68G9g/viewform?usp=send_form). You cannot opt-out of our message deletion moderation logs, instead please contact your server administrator and ask them to disable this feature in their server. Upon purging messages, we will collect all messages purged and send them in a log to the designated logging channel (if setup). These messages are temporarily stored in our servers for no more than 10 seconds. As stated in our message logs when posted, they are not stored in our server and if you choose to delete the message, there is no way to recover the messages. If you use the global chat, your message will be scanned by our spam & toxicity prevention systems to make sure your message is appropriate. We do store messages sent in the global chat for no more than 1 month, but they are encrypted. If you remove the bot from your server, we will remove all data automatically that is not related for moderation purposes (such as server blacklist status). Please understand that **we do not store messages sent by you that are not Aerex bot commands**. If you wish to opt-out of data collection, you may fill out [this form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjlf5wDgjW3F6hXVrz7DN14BL4cT_XwUS2K-ZLSeHgV68G9g/viewform?usp=send_form). Please continue reading to understand what data we will remove.

## Data Removal Request:
As stated earlier, you may remove your data by [filling out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjlf5wDgjW3F6hXVrz7DN14BL4cT_XwUS2K-ZLSeHgV68G9g/viewform?usp=send_form). Upon filling out this form, you can expect you or your server's data to be removed within 14 days. The bot may leave your server (if you are requesting server data deletion) and/or may be inaccessible to you if you choose to do so.

**Data we remove:**
* `Snipe` command messages
* Your server's stored tags
* Your server's stored games
* Your stored calculations from the `calculate` command
* Your `quartett` command data
* Your `quiz` command results
* Your server's premium status

**Data we will not remove:**
* You or your server's blacklist status
* You or your server's antispam status
* Any stored internal infractions against you or your server

We will not be removing you or your server's blacklist or antispam status for the sole purpose of bot security. You can expect your data to be fully removed within 14 days.

## Assistance:
If you would like clarification or assistance on certain matters, please feel free to [join our support server](https://discord.gg/BYuUvE4). We will be more than happy to help you.

## Policy Updates:
As we add and remove certain features, this privacy policy is guaranteed to be updated at times. For larger updates, we will most likely notify you through our [support server](https://discord.gg/BYuUvE4) (in our #announcements channel), but it is mainly your responsibility to keep checking back on this policy to see if it updates. We will be posting a "last updated" date to show that we updated our policy. For larger updates, we will be posting a notice at the top of this policy stating the larger changes we have made.
